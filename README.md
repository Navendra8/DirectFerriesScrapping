## Description
This is a simple Python program that performs sentiment analysis on a given text using the TextBlob library. Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. The TextBlob library is a popular library used for natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.

The program takes a text input from the user and returns the sentiment expressed in the text along with a polarity score ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a negative sentiment, 0 indicates a neutral sentiment, and 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You also need to install the TextBlob library, which you can do by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install textblob
```

## Usage
To use this program, simply run the `sentiment_analysis.py` file in your terminal or Python IDE of choice. Follow the prompts to enter the text you want to analyze. 

The program will output the sentiment expressed in the text and the polarity score. If the sentiment is positive, the output will be displayed in green; if it is negative, the output will be displayed in red; and if it is neutral, the output will be displayed in yellow.
